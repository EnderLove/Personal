# JUST A PERSONAL PROJECT

This project is meant to become some kind of "data structure library" but for now is just a simple testing field for my personal learning path.

---

- [1] Do the most important data structures in C and C++. 
- [2] Start to learn how to do unitary testing. 
- [3] Improve my project organization skills. 
- [4] Build a library for future purposes. 
- [5] Enjoy the process.
